TubeKit is a toolkit to build crawlers for YouTube. Details of using it can be found from TubeKit website or in the documentation included here. To access the TubeKit, follow these steps.

2. Point your browser to 'TubeKit' directory through your web-server (e.g., http://localhost/TubeKit/).

3. Click on 'Setup' to configure your new crawler. Click on 'Documentation' to read the instructions about how to set this up.

4. Once the setup is run, your crawler is almost ready. You will need to 
take a couple of additional steps to get it running. The details are in the documentation page.

5. Access your new crawler through the web-server, enter queries to run, and monitor it work!
